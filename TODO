first:
look - page title, html formatting

then:
more speed
- pre-render main page except of date
incremental update

maybe:
restricted for archs
make it proper module (would need a way to publish source)
packages build together only on main package
build logs only on main package
no link back from buildlog page
tar-exclude assumes root dir name
docker secret and upload over sharing volume
rewrite shell scripts in python
