first:
improve /package/glibc/aarch64-musl # if row.arch not in repos:

then:
better main page (base, popular, featured)
links to subpkgs
show site update date
restricted for archs

maybe:
incremental update
highlight newest version in table
searching
list of files from xlocate
apropos based on short_desc
