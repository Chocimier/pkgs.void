first:
look - page title, html formatting

then:
more speed
- pre-render main page except of date
incremental update

maybe:
restricted for archs
make it proper module (would need a way to publish source)
build db without binary repository
- package for arch without binary repo, or broken one, displays in search results, but has no page
packages build together only on main package
build logs only on main package
no link back from buildlog page
tar-exclude assumes root dir name
docker secret and upload over sharing volume
rewrite shell scripts in python
